This computational essay explores findings from the 2024 study “Post-January 6th deplatforming reduced the reach of misinformation on Twitter” by McCabe et al., published in Nature. <br>
I replicate their Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis using the dataset provided to assess the impact of Twitter’s deplatforming intervention.
Additionally, I explore key assumptions and provide practical insights into how content moderation strategies like this can shape online discourse. <br>
